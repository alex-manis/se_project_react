# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About the project

The idea of the application is pretty simple - we make a call to an API, which then responds with the daily weather forecast. We collect the weather data, process it, and then based on the forecast, we recommend suitable clothing to the user.

## Project features

- Vite & React
- Weather API integration
- User registration and authorization (JWT)
- Add / delete / like clothing items
- Validation
- React Router
- React Context
- Protected routes & token check

## Recent updates

- Added **registration and login** logic with protected API routes
- Implemented **CurrentUserContext** to share user data
- Added **EditProfileModal** to update user info
- Implemented **likes and dislikes** for clothing items
- Added **sign out** functionality

## Future plans

- Responsive design for different screen resolutions
